# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset from Scikit-learn. It involves data analysis, visualization, and the application of the XGBoost Regressor, a high-performance gradient boosting model. The workflow demonstrates key steps in building and evaluating a regression model to estimate house prices effectively.

## Key Features

Dataset: The project uses the California Housing Dataset, which contains features such as:

    * Median income of households

    * Median house age

    * Average number of rooms and bedrooms

    * Population and households

    * Median house value (target variable)

## Project Workflow

    * Data Loading:

    Loaded the California Housing Dataset using fetch_california_housing() from Scikit-learn.

Inspected dataset structure and feature details.

    * Data Preprocessing:

    Prepared the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Ensured data quality and readiness for modeling.

    * Model Implementation:

    Utilized the XGBoost Regressor to train the regression model on the training dataset.

Tuned hyperparameters for optimized performance.

    * Model Evaluation:

    Evaluated the model using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

Compared predictions against actual values to assess accuracy.

## Data Visualization:

Explored data patterns and relationships through visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## How to Run

Install Dependencies:
Ensure the following libraries are installed in your Python environment:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost

* Execute the Notebook:
Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment and run the cells sequentially.

## Results
